# Week 2

During our meeting for the second week, we will be covering the arithmetic operations you can use when creating a program:
* Variables
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Modulus

## Variables
Variables are the heart of programming. They allow you to define different objects of different types that you can use when creating programs. For today, we will be going over the follow:
* Integers
* Floats
* Doubles

## Operations
The first four operations in our list are fairly simple: they require little to no background information. Make sure to feel comfortable with those first.

When evaluating, also make sure to keep in mind the order of operations: they are fairly straightforward and similar to the regular PEMDAS you learn in school.

## Modulus
This is probably the only operation that may feel a bit foreign to everyone unless you've dealt with competitive mathematics before. Make sure to take time to understand it all.
