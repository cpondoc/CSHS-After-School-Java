# Week 1

During our meeting for the first week, we will be covering the following:
* Setting up an IDE
* Writing your first Java program
* System.out.print() vs System.out.println()
* Writing Comments
* Beginner Program: Getting to Know You

## Setting up and IDE
Because of the chromebooks, we will have to resort to an online IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in order to run code. The website we recommend for this is the [Sololearn website](https://www.sololearn.com/User/Login?returnUrl=%2FPlayground "SoloLearn website").

## Writing your first Java program
Once your IDE is set up, we will begin with the most fundamental program of all: the "Hello, World!" program. See Intro.java.

## System.out.print() vs System.out.println()
There are actually two different ways to output information: using both the System.out.print() method as well as the System.out.println() method. Check OutputDifference.java to see how each work.

## Writing Comments
Before you start writing complicated code, it is essential that you understand how to write comments in order to document your progress. See Comments.java.

## Beginner Program: Getting to Know You
Now that you have learned a bulk of the introductory output you need to write good Java code, let's try by practicing. Create a new IntroducingMe.java file in Sololearn, and introduce yourself to our group. What is your name, grade, etc.? What types of classes are you taking? What hobbies and extracurriculars are you a part of? Once you are done, submit the link under the Google Classroom assignment titled "Introducing Me - Beginner Java Program". See IntroducingMe.java for a peek.
