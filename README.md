# Frederick High School Computer Science Honor Society After School Coding Club

### Description
This repository holds all of the code we used for our Computer Science Honor Society's After School Coding Club. This club was intended to provide students with a gentle introduction to a programming language, which cycles every three years. In 2019, we did Java; in 2020, we will use Python; and in 2021, we will use C++ and start over from there.

### Topics Covered
Some examples of the topics our club covered included:
* Classic "Hello, World!" and other print statements
* Basic variables, such as integers, floating-point, and strings
* String concatenation
* Basic arithmetic
* Simple conditional statements
* For and While loops

### Special Thanks
Special thanks goes out to all of the Computer Science Honor Society Members who helped make this possible, especially:
* Zachary Dorris (Lead Instructor)
* Chris Pondoc (Lead Instructor)
* Nathan Pan
